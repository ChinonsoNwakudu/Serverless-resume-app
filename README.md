My personal resume website using serverless technologies, with backend APIs to fetch and update the resume data.

# First Steps (Static Resume Website)
My frontend folder contains my static website. The static resume website is built using HTML and CSS. It is hosted on Azure Blob Storage with static website hosting enabled.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Created a storage account in [Azure](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
2. Enabled static website hosting.
3. Uploaded my frontend files: `index.html`, `main.js` and `css files` to the `$web` container.
4. Accessed the website using the **Primary Endpoint URL**.
